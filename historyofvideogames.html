    <h1>History of Video Games</h1>
    <p>Video games are digital games that can be played on a computer device (e.g., tablets, smartphones, laptops, consoles, etc.).<br><em>Originally</em> designed simply for entertainment, video games have grown into their own industry and field of learning,<br>generating<strong> billions of dollars</strong> each year.</p>
    
    <p>"All your base are belong to us"</p>

    <h2>The Beginnings (1950s)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In 1950, Claude Shannon lays out the basic guidelines for programming a chess-playing computer in an article,<br>"Programming a Computer for Playing Chess." That same year both he and Englishman Alan Turing create chess programs.</li>
      <li>In 1952, A. S. Douglass creates <em>OXO</em> (a game known as noughts and crosses in the United Kingdom and tic-tac-toe in the United States)<br>on Cambridge's EDSAC computer as part of his research on human-computer interactions.</li>
      <li>In 1959, students at MIT create <em>Mouse in the Maze</em> on MIT's TX-0 computer. Users first draw a maze with a light pen,<br>then a mouse navigates the labyrinth searching for cheese. In a revised version, a bibulous mouse seeks out martinis yet still somehow<br>remembers the path it took.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Video Games at Home (1960-1982)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In 1968, Ralph Baer patents his interactive television game. Four years later Magnavox releases Odyssey, the first home video game system,<br>based on his designs.</li>
      <li>In 1978, Taito's <em>Space Invaders</em> descends on Japan, causing a shortage of 100-yen coins. Within a year, 60,000 Space Invaders machines<br>in the United States tempt Americans to spend millions of quarters driving back the seemingly unstoppable ranks of attacking aliens.</li>  
      <li>In 1981, video game fans go ape over Nintendo’s <em>Donkey Kong</em>, featuring a character that would become world-famous: Jumpman. Never heard of him?<br>That’s because he’s better known as Mario—the name he took when his creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, makes him the star of a later game by Nintendo.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>North American Video Game Crash (1983)</h2>
    <p>Some video gaming consoles available during 1983 include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Atari 5200</li>
      <li>Vectrex</li>
      <li>Compact Vision TV Boy</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Rise of Games in the East (1985-1995)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In 1985, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) revives an ailing United States video game industry two years after the<br>Nintendo Corporation released it in Japan as Famicom.</li>
      <li>In 1989, Nintendo's Game Boy popularizes handheld gaming. Game Boy is not the first handheld system with interchangeable<br>cartridges—Milton Bradley introduced Microvision 10 years earlier—but it charms users with its good game play, ease of use, and long battery life.</li>
      <li>In 1995, Sony releases PlayStation in the United States, selling for $100 less than Sega Saturn. The lower price point, along with the<br>arrival of Nintendo 64 in 1996, weakens Sega's home console business. When Sony PlayStation 2 debuts in 2000, it becomes the<br>dominant home console and Sega exits the home console business.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tech Company Takeover (1995-2010)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In 2001, Microsoft enters the video game market with Xbox and hit games like <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>. Four years later, Xbox 360 gains<br>millions of fans with its advanced graphics and seamless online play.</li>
      <li>In 2004, Nintendo maintains its dominance of the handheld market with the Nintendo DS, an easy-to-use, portable gaming system packed with<br>two processors, two screens, multiplayer capabilities, and a stylus for the touchscreen. Great games like <em>Super Mario Kart DS</em> helped too.</li>
      <li>In 2006, Nintendo Wii gets gamers off the couch and moving with innovative, motion-sensitive remotes. Not only does Nintendo make gaming<br>more active, it also appeals to millions of people who never before liked video games.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Today in Gaming (2010-Now)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In 2010, the indie game movement comes of age with the tremendous popularity of <em>Minecraft</em>, the addictive brick-building game from Swedish developer Markus Persson.</li>
      <li>In 2013, <em>Gone Home</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, and <em>Papers, Please</em> usher in a new wave of mature video game stories that confront players with tough<br>emotional choices in ethically-complex worlds.</li>
      <li>In 2014, “Free-to-play” becomes a dominant business model as blockbusters such as <em>CrossFire</em>, <em>Clash of Clans</em>, <em>World of Tanks</em>, and even<br><em>Kim Kardashian: Hollywood</em> achieve sales in the hundreds of millions of dollars through microtransaction payments for in-game items and premium content.</li>
      <li>In 2016, players hunt for virtual creatures like Pikachu and Horsea in the real world with Niantic’s free-to-play hit <em>Pokémon Go</em>. It’s the<br>gaming sensation of the summer, and commenters debate whether it’s just a fad or represents a bright future for augmented reality.</li>
      <li>In 2017, Nintendo’s Switch introduces the first hybrid mobile/home video game console into a game market dominated by smartphones and tablets.<br>The innovative system allows players to take hit games like <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> with them wherever they go.</li>
